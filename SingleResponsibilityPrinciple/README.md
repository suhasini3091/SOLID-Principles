	• SRP - A class should have only 1 responsibility 
		○ Controls the flow of the application
		○ Broken the whole application into different classes
		○ Each class a different functionality
		○ Separating the classes, helps in differentiating the functionality
		○ Easier to read, debug and makes it very easy for a new developer to contribute at a faster pace
		○ Everything is just chunks so very easy to understand the whole application
		○ Broken the application into different pieces
		○ SRP for interfaces comes another design principles
		○ When we change a small part inside a class, so the change applies to the entire application
		○ If a class is too big and you need to scroll off the screen then its too big, then split it apart and make it easier for you to work faster and more efficiently
